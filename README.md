## Introduction

This project aims to provide a complete implementation of a Lease smart contract.

All smart contract code is written in Solidity and is intended to be deployed in the Ethereum blockchain.

Solidity documentation can be found here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/index.html

## Installation

To install the solidity compiler, run `sudo apt install solc`

To check for gas values, run `solc contract.sol --gas`

To use the Node.js environment to test the contracts, run `npm install`

## Testing

The following command compiles the contracts and runs all tests: `npm test`
